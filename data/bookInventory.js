        "description": "The Tempest is the last play William Shakespeare wrote before retirement from the world of the stage. This drama presents you “The Bard of Avon” at his very best, with subtle and well-thought references universally relatable in the true Shakespearean Style. Prospero, the rightful Duke of Milan, is currently in exile on a mysterious island, because his Dukedom was usurped by his brother Antonio, who was at the start of the drama returning back to his Kingdom with his fleet of ships. He passes by the island where he exiled Prospero, that’s when his fleet of ships was hit by a violent storm caused by Prospero through his mystic powers. The drama centres around themes of Love, Revenge, and Forgiveness. It can often be regarded as “a dark comedy”. Shakespeare weaves together magical and fantastical elements together with exploration and discovery in a cohesive manner. Such supernatural elements are presented to us through Caliban, Prospero’s slave, the son of a hag and the only native resident of the island, and by Ariel who is bound to serve Prospero, as Prospero rescued him from a tree. The Novel also has hidden themes of Confinement, Freedom, and Colonialism through Prospero, a foreign man who comes to this magical island, and subjugates the island, it’s magic, and the native people (Caliban). Overall the Novel provides an apt Shakespeare Experience for which he is well-known. The book is a paperback book with well-arranged illustrations and optimized for a relaxed and enjoyable reading experience. Happy Reading!",

A system which seemingly ensures that at the end of the day one gets what one deserves. This grossly over-simplified understanding has created many complexities in our lives and taken away from us the very fundamentals of the joy of living",
